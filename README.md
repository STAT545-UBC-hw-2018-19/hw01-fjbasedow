## STAT545 Homework 1 Repository

Hi! 

My name is Rike and I'm doing a Master's in Neuroscience!

This is how neurons look like:

This fall I am taking [STAT545](http://stat545.com/) and this repo contains my first homework for this class. 

You can find the [instructions](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-fjbasedow/blob/master/hw01_instructions.md) for the homework in this repo but in short it consists of two parts:
* to fill this README.md
* to explore a data set

For the data exploration part I used the `Titanic` data set from R Studio, which contains data of the survival of passengers on the Titanic. :ship: I had a look at the number of passengers on the Titanic and calculated how many of them survived. If you are interested, you can find my analysis in the [Data exploration folder](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-fjbasedow/tree/master/Data%20exploration) or here is a direct link to the [md file](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-fjbasedow/blob/master/Data%20exploration/HW01-Titanic_exploration.md).
