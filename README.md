## STAT545 Homework 1 repo

Hi! My name is Rike and I'm doing a Master's in Neuroscience! 

This repo contains my homework 1 for [STAT 545](http://stat545.com/).

Here are the [instructions](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-fjbasedow/blob/master/hw01_instructions.md) for this homework.

Homework 1 contains of two parts:
* to fill this README.md
* to explore a data set

For the data exploration I used the `Titanic` data set, which contains data of the survival of passengers on the Titanic. :ship:
My analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-fjbasedow/blob/master/Data%20exploration/HW01-Titanic_exploration.md).
